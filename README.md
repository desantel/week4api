When user opens web page they are shown a start button. As seen here [img](./itstarts.png).
When user hits the start button a question appears and a timer begins. As seen here [img](./timerandquestion.png).
As user answer questions, they will either gain a point for a correct answer or lose 10 sec on the clock for an incorrect answer.
